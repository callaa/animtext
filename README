AnimText
--------

A tool for generating old DOS prompt style text animations.

This utility was originally made to generate the ending credit sequence for a student film project.

## Input file format

The file is structured into blocks like this:
\This is text\ \%n\

The first block is just text that is printed as it is.
Blocks that start with '%' are command blocks. (If you need to
start a text block with %, use %%)
Lines starting with '#' are ignored.

Supported command blocks:

    PAUSE: \%p<duration><format>\		Duration is an integer.
    					format can be 's' for seconds, 'm' for
    					milliseconds or 'f' for frames.
    					Example:
    					\%p1s\   \pause for 1 second\
    					\%p500s\ \pause for half a second\

    TYPEWRITER: \%t<duration><format>\	Types out the next text block single
    					character at a time. Accepts same
    					duration and format arguments as PAUSE.
    					If duration is negative, it is used as
    					the number of characters to be printed
    					per frame.
    
    CURSOR: \%C<duration><format>\		Show/hide the cursor.
    
    CLEARSCREEN: \%c\			Clear the screen.
    
    NEWLINE: \%n\				Start a new line.
    
    BACKSPACE: \%b\				Backspace

Note. CURSOR and NEWLINE commands are ignored in console preview mode.
